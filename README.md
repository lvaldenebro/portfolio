# Portfolio

## Introduction

This Portoflio wants to be a small piece that shows what can I do while playing with new technologies and learning for them. From heere, you can easily access to my project in order of importance, as well as you can review the code and see how I approach the use of new technologies.

Welcome to my Play Place!

## Design & Color Reference

The design of this web site is a personal attempt of creating something unique and distinctive, at the same time that shows a little of my personality.

The color reference is taken from www.colorhunt.com and the colors are:

- #ada2ff
- #c0deff
- #ffe5f1
- #fff8e1
- pure black
- pure white

The idea under this colors is to represent the notebook we used to use to learn in the school, as this is my new learning place. I always loved highlights so I though, why not?

## Tech Stack

This is a SPA built over React with create-react-app, as the idea of this project is that it will be changed and improved, this v 1.0 is componentized taking into account the future scalability.

THe list of technologies is: React, React Router DOM, propTypes, HTML5 and Bootstrap (as base) modified with Sass.

## How to use the project

It is a Static SPA so the use is pretty simple. The interactivity is limited to the two nav bars located in the top and the back of the page, and he icons of contact or the projects. For contact, just click on the icon or the sentences that goes with it and it will open for you the corresponding place you are trying to reach. With the the projects is similar, just click into the web navigation or into the github navigation to see the code or the demo.

## Installation

If you really want to install this project in you computer, you need to follow this easy steps:

- `npm install` to create the node_modules folder
- `npm start` to run the demo in your computer

## Optimizations ans Further Work

- I will add proptypes to check if props are WAI
