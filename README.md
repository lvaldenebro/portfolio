# Portfolio

## Introduction

This Portfolio wants to be a small piece that shows what can I do while playing with new technologies and learning for them. From here, you can easily access my projects in order of importance, as well as review their code and see how I approach the use of new technologies.

Welcome to my Playground!

## Design & Color Reference

The design of this web site is a personal attempt to create something unique and distinctive, while at the same time showing a little of my personality. It is responsible, with a mobile-first approach, so you can access to it using any device.

The color reference is taken from www.colorhunt.com and the colors are:

- #ada2ff
- #c0deff
- #ffe5f1
- #fff8e1
- pure black
- pure white

The idea under these colors is to represent the notebook we used to use to learn in school, as this is my new learning place. I always loved highlights so I thought, why not?

## Tech Stack

This is a SPA built over React with create-react-app, as the idea of this project is that it will be changed and improved, this v 1.0 is made with components taking into account the future scalability.

THe list of technologies is: React, propTypes, HTML5 and Bootstrap (as a base) modified with Sass.

This is the first place I use Bootstrap so, be kind!

## How to use the project

It is a Static SPA so the use is pretty simple. The interactivity is limited to the two nav bars located in the top and bottom of the page, and the icons for contact or projects. To contact me, just click on the icon or the sentence that goes with it and it will open for you the corresponding place you are trying to reach. With the projects is similar, just click into the web navigation or into the github navigation to see the code or the demo.

## Installation

If you really want to install this project in your computer, you need to follow these easy steps:

- Clone the repo into your computer
- `npm install` to create the node_modules folder
- `npm start` to run the demo in your computer

Otherwise, remember that you can reach the demo in both: [lvaldenebro.github.io/portfolio/](lvaldenebro.github.io/portfolio/) or www.lauravaldenebro.com

## Optimizations ans Further Work

- I will add propTypes to check if props are WAI
- Add testing to check if they links WAI
- etc.
