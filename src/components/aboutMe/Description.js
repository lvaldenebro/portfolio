        <p className="description">Horse jumping requires planning, discipline and practice, but also such a strong link between rider and animal that they act as a single being. That's me, a team player with a unique and different perspective that helps me find innovative solutions to all problems. Always in a crusade for self-explicative and super-effective code, I'm looking for a place to apply all my experience in tech while I evolve and learn as a fullstack developer. My motto: "try, learn, share".</p>
